    v "Well, alright, I'll explain it to you."
    scene v3

    v "First, this place is not commonplace and regarding circle's glow, that's because the circle is a magical array."
    v "When a magical array detects the presence of a person who has magic power, it will react."
    v "I also do not know who made it, but obviously, this place has abundant energy. If someone who has awakened their magic power practices here, it will increase their magic power tenfold faster than other places."
    mc "Magic power?"
    t "She said Magic power so did she already know I'm a mage?"
    "...."

    mc "By the way, how did you find this place, Viona?"
    v "It was by chance when I was on a mission and I came across it."
    mc "But why did you bring me here?"
    v "Because I can feel that you have a great magic power in you and I know you're also a mage, right? But your body is too weak to be able to use your whole strength."
    v "I estimate you can only use 30 percent of your magic power, even if you know how to use it!"
    t "Of course I know how to use it, but what she's said is right. My body is still not ready. I can only use 30 percent of my magic power. If I use my full power, it can destroy my body."
    mc "So you're also a mage, isn't being a mage very rare?"
    v "Yes, that's right, people with the potential to be a mage are very rare, but what makes me curious is how you awakened your magic power? Did you have a Master?"
    mc "Well, it's secret hehe...but I didn't have a Master."
    v "Hmm...strange!"
    "....."
    mc "You are also a member of the '{b}{i}Outong{/i}{/b}' Guild, right? How many people there have magic power?"
    v "There are only two mages in the '{b}{i}Outong{/i}{/b}' Guild, me and the Guild Master."
    v "Hey, [name], why don't you join the '{b}{i}Outong{/i}{/b}' Guild?"
    v "If you are interested, you can tell them that I invited you, they will surely welcome you with pleasure."
    mc "Why is that?"
    v "Well, because I am a Guild Deputy."
    mc "Really? So you and Scarlet are the Guild Deputies, is Lucy too? How many Guild Deputies are there in the '{b}{i}Outong{/i}{/b}' Guild?"
    v "Actually, there are only two Guild Deputies, namely me and Scarlet, but, hey... Do you know Scarlet?"
    mc "Well, about that, actually she's my [ss]."
    scene v5
    with d
    v "Really? So you are her [br]? But why didn't she ever say that she has a [br]?"
    v "Anyway, if you join, maybe the Guild Master can help you train your body to become stronger, so you can use your magic power."
    mc "I'll consider it."

    t "Hmm... Maybe she doesn't know that I can use my magic power, because by wearing this ring, I seem to have received the memories of old Mage Zerocus about how to use his magic."
